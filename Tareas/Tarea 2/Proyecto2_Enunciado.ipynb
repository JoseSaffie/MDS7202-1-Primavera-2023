Para motivar la construcción de nuevas características, se recomienda explorar las siguientes posibilidades:\n","\n","- Generar ratios que relacionen variables categóricas con numéricas. Estos ratios permiten capturar relaciones proporcionales o comparativas entre diferentes categorías y valores numéricos.\n","- Combinación de rankings entre variables numéricas y categóricas.\n","- Discretización de variables numéricas a categóricas.\n","- Etc...\n","\n","**Importantes**: Al explorar estas posibilidades no se limiten solo a estas propuestas, pueden aplicar otras técnicas de feature engineering pertinentes para mejorar la capacidad de su modelo para comprender y aprovechar los patrones presentes en los datos.
